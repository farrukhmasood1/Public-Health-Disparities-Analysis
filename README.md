Public Health Analytics: County-Level Predictive Modeling
This project applies machine learning and clustering techniques to the 2025 County Health Rankings dataset, which covers all 3,142 U.S. counties, to explore the socioeconomic and healthcare drivers of premature mortality. The dataset, compiled by the University of Wisconsin’s Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, includes measures on health outcomes, healthcare infrastructure, environment, education, and economic conditions.
The analysis begins with data preparation and exploratory data analysis (EDA), addressing missing values, outliers, and distribution patterns across 50+ variables. Using clustering methods such as K-means and hierarchical clustering, the project uncovers distinct groups of counties with similar health challenges, revealing patterns in access to healthcare, poverty, and environmental exposures that drive disparities in outcomes.
To move from description to prediction, two supervised learning models (linear regression and random forest) were trained to estimate premature mortality, defined as Years of Potential Life Lost before age 75 (YPLL75). The models achieved strong predictive performance (R² > 0.70), with results highlighting healthcare access, income inequality, child poverty, and environmental risks as the most significant predictors of early deaths.
The findings are translated into evidence-based policy recommendations with a focus on Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, though the framework is generalizable to other local and national contexts. Recommendations emphasize improving access to primary care and mental health providers, reducing socioeconomic inequities, and strengthening preventive health infrastructure. By combining advanced analytics with actionable policy insights, this project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can guide governments and development institutions in addressing health inequities at scale.
